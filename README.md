# Project 00008

## 📖 Overview
Project 00008 is part of my SQL portfolio series.  
It demonstrates structured database design, relational queries, and workflow organization using **SQLite**.  
The goal is to make this project **easy to clone, run, and understand** for anyone reviewing my work.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jrhcorp2023Git/Project00008.git
cd Project00008

2. 	Open SQLite or your preferred SQL client.

3. 	Run the schema file:

sqlite3 project00008.db < sql/schema.sql

4. 	Load sample data:

sqlite3 project00008.db < sql/data_inserts.sql

5. 	Execute queries from:

sqlite3 project00003.db < sql/queries.sql

These blocks are ready to paste into your README. GitHub will render them as neat tables, making your queries and outputs easy to follow.
👉 Do you want me to also add a short SQL snippet above each table so recruiters can see the query that produced the result? That often makes the demo feel more complete.

This version is **clean, recruiter-ready, and technically precise**. It shows off your workflow clarity and SQL focus while leaving room for future enhancements like the ERD diagram.  

👉 Would you like me to help you **generate a simple ERD diagram** for your schema now, so you can drop it straight into the `docs/` folder and reference it in the README?
