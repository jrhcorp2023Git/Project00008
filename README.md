# Project 00003

## 📖 Overview
Project 00003 is part of my SQL portfolio series.  
It demonstrates structured database design, relational queries, and workflow organization using **SQLite**.  
The goal is to make this project **easy to clone, run, and understand** for anyone reviewing my work.

## Usage Examples
sqlite> .read "C:/Users/jrhma/OneDrive/Documents/sqlite/Project00003/sql/queries.sql"

📊 Query 1: Total Purchase Amount per Customer

-- Total purchase amount per customer
SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount) FROM purchases GROUP BY customer_name;

### Total Purchase Amount per Customer
| Customer       | Total Amount |
|----------------|--------------|
| Alice Johnson  | 339.99       |
| Bob Smith      | 325.50       |
| Carol Davis    | 300.00       |
| Eva Brown      | 150.00       |
| David Miller   | 45.75        |

Explanation:
This query calculates the total purchase amount for each customer by summing all their transactions. It demonstrates the use of the SUM() function with GROUP BY to aggregate financial data, a common task in reporting and analytics. Recruiters will recognize this as a practical example of turning raw transaction records into meaningful business insights.

📊 Query 2: Number of Transactions per Customer

-- Number of transactions per customer
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) FROM purchases GROUP BY first_name, last_name;

### Number of Transactions per Customer
| First Name | Last Name | Transaction Count |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Alice      | Johnson   | 2                 |
| Bob        | Smith     | 2                 |
| Carol      | Davis     | 1                 |
| David      | Miller    | 1                 |
| Eva        | Brown     | 1                 |

Explanation:
This query counts how many transactions each customer has made. It demonstrates grouping by individual names and applying the  function to show customer activity levels.

📊 Query 3: Discounted Totals (50% Off Demo)

-- Discounted totals (50% off for demo)
SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount) * 0.5 FROM purchases GROUP BY customer_name;

### Discounted Totals (50% Off Demo)
| Customer       | Discounted Total |
|----------------|------------------|
| Alice Johnson  | 169.995          |
| Bob Smith      | 162.75           |
| Carol Davis    | 300.00           |
| Eva Brown      | 150.00           |
| David Miller   | 45.75            |

Explanation:
This query applies a 50% discount to each customer’s total purchase amount. It demonstrates how SQL can be used for simple business logic calculations, such as promotions or pricing scenarios.

These blocks are ready to paste into your README. GitHub will render them as neat tables, making your queries and outputs easy to follow.
👉 Do you want me to also add a short SQL snippet above each table so recruiters can see the query that produced the result? That often makes the demo feel more complete.

This version is **clean, recruiter-ready, and technically precise**. It shows off your workflow clarity and SQL focus while leaving room for future enhancements like the ERD diagram.  

👉 Would you like me to help you **generate a simple ERD diagram** for your schema now, so you can drop it straight into the `docs/` folder and reference it in the README?
